        <p><span class="yellow-emphasis">I write CSS + HTML</span>. I use <span class="yellow-emphasis">LESS, SASS,</span> and <span class="yellow-emphasis">vanilla CSS,</span> depending on project. This is, professionally, nearly all I've done since 1997. Seeing iterations of browsers and OSes from IE5, Netscape and Windows to modern day devices and releases that dramatically affect how code is interpreted has set up a lasting habit of writing clean, non-hacky code.</p>
        <p>I've taken OCD from a place of 'have to', to a place of 'do I get to?', focusing it on organization, naming policies that make sense and the DRY method of writing CSS. Every day is an adventure in code, every single discovery is as exciting as the first time I made something appear on a web page with just CSS. I absolutely <span class="yellow-emphasis">LOVE what I do</span>.</p>
        <p>I've written CSS + HTML frameworks from the ground up for award-winning apps and websites, a Point of Sale system and backend product management. And very soon, I will take the writing I've done my entire life, and put it in a room with my experience with CSS + HTML. I have much to share.</p>

            <span>Website and flagship product</span>
            <p>Ayogo was one of my favorite places to work, paired with an excellent dev team and brilliant designers. I was lucky to have had 2 years there and I loved working with such gifted people.</p>
            <p>I wrote the CSS + HTML framework for their flagship product, Empower. I worked alongside designers, UX specialists, psychologists and developers to create a re-usable, whitelabelled, modular app frame to use as a base going forward. The devs later worked with me to inject angular modules into the framework. Organizing and writing a year long project with so many intricasies was one of the most profound learning experiences in my career.</p>
            <p>I wrote a theme for ayogo.com's new face as well, and worked with our designers to bring their vision to life. The theme, CSS + HTML were all my responsibility as was maintaining it while there.</p>
