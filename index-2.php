        <p>I create advanced, cross-browser + cross-platform compatible, standards-compliant CSS frameworks tailored for individual projects, using LESS/SASS/Vanilla CSS + HTML.</p>
        <p> I can also work with existing CSS, either in existing frameworks like Bootstrap, or plain CSS in legacy web applications.</p>
        <p>I work hard to make my projects beautiful on everything, coded mobile-first and have an eye for designing with code in-browser.</p>

        <p>I design modern websites and apps with the end user in mind, paying attention to behaviour, workflow, user-flow and best practices based on 20 years of experience from the birth of the web to today's evolving ecosystem.</p>
        <p>I sketch and draw on an iPad Pro, which has been so much fun to explore. Truly handy for quick idea sketches in design meetings on the fly as well.</p>

        <p>I work directly with developers in order to make their applications effective, and I work directly with marketers and other designers to make sure their vision is functional, accessible, and easy to maintain.</p>
        <p>I can read a designer's mind because I am one, and I have both set up frameworks ahead of time for programmers, and come in after they're done to make the app/website work on everything.</p>
